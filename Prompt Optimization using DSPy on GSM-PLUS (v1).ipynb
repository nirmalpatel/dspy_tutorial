    "# Prompt Optimization using DSPy on GSM-PLUS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I will show how to use dspy library to discover a good few-shot LLM prompt for math a math dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using dspy, you don't have to work with prompts directly. Instead, you can work with classes and their variables that define properties of your prompt. For example, question and answer are properties of a prompt that aims to solve a math problem. Ideally, you want to pass question and answer using variables instead of inserting them into the prompt. You also may not want to maintain a string constant of your prompt but instead define your LLM program in a more structured way by giving a basic task definition. This concept of LLM program definition is called a signature in the dspy. Let's jump into it and ot her key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key dspy concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "__Signature__ - Definition of your task and input/output variables. Contains task definition and brief descriptions of your input and output variables\n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples__ - List of Example class instances, contains all of the properties that are part of your signature. You will typically have lists of train and validation sets, each with instances of the Example class\n",
    "\n",
    "__Module__ - Define how the inference will happen. Use your signature and build a forward() method, similar to PyTorch's forward() method\n",
    "\n",
    "__Predictors__ - These are functions that convert signature into a text prompt. There are many prompting strategies that have shown better results e.g. chain of thought. Dspy provides these primitives, and by passing your signature to the predictor of a type, the library will make the text prompt for you. The text prompt also contains the signature input/output and their descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "__Validation Function__ - A function that takes true label and predicted label and gives a truth value back after comparing them. This function can be simple or complex, and you can also use LLMs to check for equuality of values\n",
    "\n",
    "__Optimizer__ - The Optimizer will take your Module and training set (a list of Example instances) and run an optimization algorithm to discover accurate prompt. Optimizers use two main strategies: few-shot examples and instruction optimization. Few-shot strategy picks random examples from the train set to create a prompt with examples, and iterates this prompt over time to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Evaluator__ - Evaluation config that lets you run eval on your validation set, also uses validation function to show you accuracy of the LLM for your task"
